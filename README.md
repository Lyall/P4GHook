# P4GHook
This is a very work-in-progress ultrawide fix for Persona 4 Golden. 

## Features
- Ultrawide support
- Disable CRT effects
- Intro skip

## Installation
- Downloaded the [latest release](https://github.com/Lyall/P4GHook/releases).
- Unzip in to the Persona 4 Golden game directory (e.g **steamapps/common/Persona 4 Golden**).
- Edit **P4GHook.ini** to adjust settings.

## Known Issues
This fix is very hacky right now so you may run in to quite a few issues.
- Centered UI results in several visual quirks.
- Artifacting near the edge of the screen at 32:9 or wider.
- This will not be compatible with other mods that proxy dinput8.dll
